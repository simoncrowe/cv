\section{SUMMARY} An engineer with extensive experience building and maintaining
                  platforms and cloud-native backends, I'm looking for technical challenges
                  and new opportunities to add value.\
                  In my day-to-day work, I propagate conventions and best practices\
                  through code review, refactoring and technical documentation.\
                  Iâ€™m comfortable working in cross-functional agile teams.\
                  Practices I feel at home with include IaC, CI/CD and TDD.
