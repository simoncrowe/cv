\section{SUMMARY} As an experienced backend engineer, I take ownership of features,\
                  research problems and accelerate delivery by unblocking teammates.\
                  I aspire to write code that is readable, maintainable, testable \
                  and adherent to standards and conventions.\
                  I'm comfortable working in cross-functional agile teams, grooming user stories and\
                  writing more technical tickets if needed.\ 
                  I feel at home with infrastructure-as-code, CI/CD and TDD.
